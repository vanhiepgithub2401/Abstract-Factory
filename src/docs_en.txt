ABSTRACT FACTORY is a CREATIONAL desgin pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without
specifying their concrete classes.

it defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete facroty
classes. Each factory type corresponds to a certain product variety.

Some examples from core Java lib:

javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance()

javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance()

javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory#newInstance()


Identification: The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object. Then, the factory is used for
creating specific sub-components
